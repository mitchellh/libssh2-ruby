# libssh2 Ruby Bindings

This library provides bindings to [libssh2](http://www.libssh2.org). LibSSH2
is a modern C-library implementing the SSH2 protocol and made by the same
people who made [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/).

**Project status:** Alpha. Much of the library is still not yet done,
and proper cross-platform testing has not been done.

## Motivation

The creation of `libssh2-ruby` was motivated primarily by edge-case issues
experienced by [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) while using
[Net-SSH](https://github.com/net-ssh/net-ssh). Net-SSH has been around 7
years and is a stable library, but the Vagrant project found that around 1%
of users were experiencing connectivity issues primarily revolving around
slightly incompliant behavior by remote servers.

`libssh2` is a heavily used library created by the same people as
[cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/), simply one of the best command line applications
around. It has been around for a few years and handles the SSH2 protocol
very well. It is under active development and the motivation for libssh2
to always work is high, since it is used by many high-profile open source
projects.

For this reason, `libssh2-ruby` was made to interface with this high
quality library and provide a stable and robust SSH2 interface for Ruby.

## Usage

The API for interacting with SSH is idiomatic Ruby and you should find
it friendly and intuitive:

```ruby
require "libssh2"

# COMING SOON!
```

However, if you require more fine-grained control, I don't want the
API to limit you in any way. Therefore, it is my intention to expose
all the native libssh2 functions on the `LibSSH2::Native`
module as singleton methods, without the `libssh2_` prefix. So if you want
to call `libssh2_init`, you actually call `LibSSH2::Native.init`. Here is
an example that executes a basic `echo` via SSH:

```ruby
require "libssh2"
include LibSSH2::Native

# Remember, we're using the _native_ interface so below looks a lot
# like C and some nasty Ruby code, but it is the direct interface
# to libssh2. libssh2-ruby also provides a more idiomatic Ruby interface
# that you can see above in the README.
session = session_init
session_set_blocking(session, true)
session_handshake(session, socket.fileno)
userauth_password(session, "username", "password")

channel = channel_open_session(session)
channel_exec(channel, "echo hello")
data, _ = channel_read(channel)

# Outputs "hello\n"
puts data
```
